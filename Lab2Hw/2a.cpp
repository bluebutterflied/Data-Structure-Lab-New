#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int *number;
    number = NULL;
    cout<<number<<endl;
}
// Here we have made the pointer number as null, before this, the pointer was having a garbage value but after making it null,
// now it has 0. This is the possible solution of the above code
